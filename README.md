**EchoEscape Project**

EchoEscape is a project currently in development, aimed at providing users with a comprehensive tool to check the bias and truthfulness of articles, as well as recommend related articles with different viewpoints. This initial version serves as a simple bias checker, truthfulness checker, and article recommender.

**Project Overview**

EchoEscape is designed to help users navigate through media bias and misinformation by providing:

**Bias Checker:** 
Analyze the political bias of an article to determine if it leans left, right, or center.\n
**Truthfulness Checker:** 
Assess the credibility of the claims made in the article.\n
**Article Recommender:** 
Suggest related articles from different perspectives to give users a more balanced view of the topic.\n

**Future Vision**

Our goal is to develop EchoEscape into a robust API that can be integrated with social media platforms. This will enable users to evaluate the bias and truthfulness of social media posts in real-time, promoting a broader understanding and discovery of diverse opinions.

**In Development**

Integration with social media platforms.
Enhanced algorithms for more accurate bias and truthfulness assessments.
Expanded database of news sources and fact-checking resources.
Input article URLs to check for bias and truthfulness.
Receive recommendations for related articles with varying biases.
Simple web interface for easy article submission and labeling.
Creating our own AI model to detect truthfulnees and bias

We hope to empower users with the tools to critically evaluate the information they consume and foster a more informed and open-minded society.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and improve EchoEscape!
