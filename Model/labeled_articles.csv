"Israel’s war on Gaza live: Death toll passes 37,000 after ‘barbaric attack’. Israel’s raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp has caused outrage, with the EU calling it “a massacre”. The death toll has risen to 274 with more than 700 others injured, Gaza’s health ministry says. Doctors describe the scenes inside Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza as a “complete bloodbath”, with one medic saying the inside of the hospital “looks like a slaughterhouse”. Doctors Without Borders says Al-Aqsa and Nasser hospitals are “overwhelmed”. Israeli forces said they rescued four captives held in the attack at the Nuseirat refugee camp amid criticism over the large number of civilian causalities. One Israeli officer died during the deadly raid. Hamas’s military spokesman says Israel killed captives in its Nuseirat operation, without specifying the circumstances or how many were killed. At least 37,084 people have been killed and 84,494 injured in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 7. The revised death toll in Israel from Hamas’s attacks stands at 1,139, with dozens of people still held captive in Gaza.","Pro-Palestinian"
"JERUSALEM (AP) — The proportion of Palestinian women and children being killed in the Israel-Hamas war appears to have declined sharply, an Associated Press analysis of Gaza Health Ministry data has found, a trend that both coincides with Israel’s changing battlefield tactics and contradicts the ministry’s own public statements. The trend is significant because the death rate for women and children is the best available proxy for civilian casualties in one of the 21st century’s most destructive conflicts. In October, when the war began, it was above 60%. For the month of April, it was below 40%. Yet the shift went unnoticed for months by the U.N. and much of the media, and the Hamas-linked Health Ministry has made no effort to set the record straight. Israel faces heavy international criticism over unprecedented levels of civilian casualties in Gaza and questions about whether it has done enough to prevent them in an 8-month-old war that shows no sign of ending. Two recent airstrikes in Gaza killed dozens of civilians. The AP analysis highlights facts that have been overlooked and could help inform the public debate, said Gabriel Epstein, a research assistant at the Washington Institute for Near East policy who has also studied the Health Ministry data. The declining impact on women and children -- as well as a drop in the overall death rate -- are “definitely due to a change in the way the IDF is acting right now,” Epstein said, using an acronym for the Israeli army. “That’s an easy conclusion, but I don’t think it’s been made enough.” Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, said his group has always found the Health Ministry’s numbers to be “generally reliable” because it has direct access to hospitals and morgues. Whatever the reason for fewer women and child being killed, Shakir said, in the grand scheme, the trend pales when compared with the war’s overall devastation. “The death toll may be an undercount,” he added, because many bodies are still under rubble and the war has made it difficult for the Health Ministry to comprehensively gather data.","Center"
"IDF says strike hit Hamas command room housed in container at Gaza City UN school. Army doesn’t say how many gunmen hit; Palestinians say 15 dead, including at least 3 civilians; IDF identifies 17 terror operatives killed in Thursday strike on UNRWA school. By EMANUEL FABIAN FOLLOW and TOI STAFF. 7 June 2024, 10:11 pm. Youths inspect damage to a storage container that was hit by an Israeli strike at the Asmaa school, run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), in Gaza City's Shati refugee camp, June 7, 2024. The IDF says a Hamas cell was operating from the container. (Omar Al-Qattaa / AFP) The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that they had carried out an airstrike on a Hamas command Center that had been set up in a United Nations school in Gaza City’s Shati neighborhood, killing several members of the cell. The strike comes a day after the IDF hit another UN school housing what it said was a compound used by dozens of terror operatives. The IDF on Friday also released the identities of another eight Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives who were among those killed in that strike, bringing the number of named terror operatives so far to to 17.","Pro-Israel"
"Israel's military said a special forces officer was killed in exchanges of fire with militants emerging from cover in residential blocks, and that it knew of 'under 100' Palestinians killed, though not how many of them were fighters or civilians. Hamas' armed wing said on Sunday three Israeli hostages, including one with U.S. citizenship, were killed during the raid, but provided no names. It released a video of what appeared to be corpses with censor bars obscuring their faces. A Hamas assertion on Saturday that some hostages had died was rejected as 'a blatant lie' by the Israeli military.","Center"
"In an update on Sunday, Gaza's health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed - up from 210 it reported on Saturday - and 698 were injured when Israeli special force commandos stormed into the densely populated Al-Nuseirat camp to rescue four hostages held since October by Hamas militants. Sixty-four of the dead were children and 57 were women, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said on Sunday.","Center"
"Gaza's health ministry said another 798 Palestinians were injured in the Israeli raid, and one of them, 4-year-old Tawfiq Abu Youssef, was in critical condition when visited in hospital on Sunday by his father Raed.

"The Israeli military said in a statement its forces were continuing operations east of Al-Bureij and Deir al-Balah, killing a number of Palestinian gunmen and destroying militant infrastructure.
